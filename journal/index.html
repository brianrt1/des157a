                There's several elements that make up a game, all games use a combination of similar ideas. Games are like experiences, where audiences can be immersed into different realities. This becomes established through game design. As a designer, setting the rules is just as important as facilitating a way for the player to identify the objective and then knowing how to get there. Working with an article from Juego gives insight into the practice behind game design, they're behind titles such as "2K21". Claiming that so much goes into a game, ranging from core gameplay such as game mechanics to sound design and sound effects – all outlined in their 7 principles of game design. Everything is to immerse the audience and keep them engaged while they reach the objective. Overall, everything done plays into the overall experience from the audience. Feedback groups can give insights into how people react to UI/UX patterns, yielding relevant feedback through user testing.

                This is picture a of a K-pop CD, the cover resting on a blanket or fabric. The picture was taken for the project, but communicates a feeling. People often take pictures of music they listen to, music listeners are passionate about spreading their love for music. This picture is no different, this is a staged picture with the CD placed at the center of the frame. With the white wall background and white fabric, this makes the CD pop by giving it a border. This makes sense because the CD is a part of a collection and multiple CD’s can be placed in that spot and photographed, while every image with be compositionally the same, the CD is different - giving a different emotion.

                This is an image taken in downtown Sacramento at a church plaza, near Southside park. In the picture, you can see “papel picado” hanging up above, or punched paper, which reads “Queen of Mexico”, because the image was taken around the time of The Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe celebration. I feel a connection to this location because as a kid my parents would bring me to church here almost every Sunday. Other images in the collection for this project are more abstracted forms, telling a story of connection to architecture through for and lines. This picture stands out for its personal meaning, vivid color, and unique guiding lines.

                An image can be used several different ways when designing for the web. Imagery to web designers is a chance to incorporate a visual language through using photographs as design elements. There are some techniques and things to avoid when using images however. Images can communicate ideas and emotions, that means that they are treated with a high level of priority in the design process. Choosing your images early on is important, building the design around the ideal imagery intentionally for the purpose. In the Microdot example by Standard Projects, Imagery is a dominant element which overall creates an immersive feeling. An animated gradient fills the background, while an image gallery fades in as you scroll down. This has a dynamic and image-centric feeling, that is more taxing on the browser. Additionally, working with many images makes creating a responsive design more challenging. Choosing the right images begins with a plan for visual styling and overall narrative of your design.

            The misuse of overlays in web design can lead to poor user experiences, where the main task is being hindered by distracting pop-ups. Overlays appear to be a convenient choice to create custom, practical forms in order to deliver or capture information without breaking your webpage. 
            This avoids having to rely on browser alerts and prompts to display information and get feedback. However, these overlays are often used improperly by making websites more cumbersome to navigate. 
            This happens for several reasons, one major reason is related to the size of the overlay which can be too large. When not optimized for mobile views, the overlay will likely cause  problems. An overlay can be easily misused, misuse of overlays impacts both accessibly and user experience, which negatively impacts usability. Consider if and overlay is appropriate for the main task, it can often be unnecessary. When used properly, it can make users feel more secure and invested in the content. Overlays are a creative medium to present and collect information, adding another layer of design language and interactivity.

            In the Medium article titled Best Practices for Form Design, author Salim Ansari gives their insight into how to properly develop a form on a web page. In their experience, they claim that the main goal in a form is to get people to complete the ultimate task. In many cases, this relates to conversions, where the user provides the information needed by a business. In order for this to go as smoothly as possible, the experience of a form must cause minimal frustrations to users. Forms have design patterns that can negatively impact user experience when misused. The author points out that 21% of checkout abandonments are caused by bad form design.

The feedback form from the YouTube nav bar is found in the bottom left of the nav. This is  a common pattern I often see, familiar and effective. This example works because the fields are clearly labeled with descriptions long enough to be read quickly. This is important for a feedback form because it offers just enough information to be useful to developers.
