            The misuse of overlays in web design can lead to poor user experiences, where the main task is being hindered by distracting pop-ups. Overlays appear to be a convenient choice to create custom, practical forms in order to deliver or capture information without breaking your webpage. 
            This avoids having to rely on browser alerts and prompts to display information and get feedback. However, these overlays are often used improperly by making websites more cumbersome to navigate. 
            This happens for several reasons, one major reason is related to the size of the overlay which can be too large. When not optimized for mobile views, the overlay will likely cause  problems. An overlay can be easily misused, misuse of overlays impacts both accessibly and user experience, which negatively impacts usability. Consider if and overlay is appropriate for the main task, it can often be unnecessary. When used properly, it can make users feel more secure and invested in the content. Overlays are a creative medium to present and collect information, adding another layer of design language and interactivity.

            In the Medium article titled Best Practices for Form Design, author Salim Ansari gives their insight into how to properly develop a form on a web page. In their experience, they claim that the main goal in a form is to get people to complete the ultimate task. In many cases, this relates to conversions, where the user provides the information needed by a business. In order for this to go as smoothly as possible, the experience of a form must cause minimal frustrations to users. Forms have design patterns that can negatively impact user experience when misused. The author points out that 21% of checkout abandonments are caused by bad form design.

The feedback form from the YouTube nav bar is found in the bottom left of the nav. This is  a common pattern I often see, familiar and effective. This example works because the fields are clearly labeled with descriptions long enough to be read quickly. This is important for a feedback form because it offers just enough information to be useful to developers.
